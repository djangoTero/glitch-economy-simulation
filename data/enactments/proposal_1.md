[THESIS]

## Summary
This proposal establishes that retroactive token dilution for treasury needs shall be prohibited, protecting contributors' earned compensation from post-hoc devaluation.

## Current State
No explicit protection exists against retroactive changes to token value or supply that could dilute previously earned compensation.

## Proposed Change
Add to @treasury_rules:
- **No Retroactive Dilution**: Token dilution or supply changes SHALL NOT apply retroactively to already-earned contributor compensation
- **Prospective-Only Treasury Adjustments**: Any token supply modifications for treasury needs apply ONLY to future earnings/distributions
- **Vested Compensation Lock**: Once compensation is earned/vested, its proportional value is protected from dilution events

## Evidence & Rationale
1. **Fair Compensation Principle**: Workers accepted tasks based on stated token value; changing this retroactively violates the implicit contract
2. **Exploitation Prevention**: Treasury-first dilution shifts organizational risk onto workers who had no voice in creating that risk
3. **Immediate Compensation Value**: Earned tokens represent completed labor - their value should be honored at time of earning
4. **Trust & Retention**: DAOs that protect earned compensation attract and retain quality contributors

## Alignment Check
- Implements @fair_compensation by preserving agreed-upon value
- Supports @worker_advocacy by prioritizing contributor interests
- Upholds @good_faith by honoring implicit agreements
- Enables @democratic_evolution by requiring prospective, voted-on changes only

## Invitation for Antithesis
I welcome counter-arguments regarding treasury flexibility, emergency scenarios, or alternative protection mechanisms. The dialectic process will strengthen this proposal.
